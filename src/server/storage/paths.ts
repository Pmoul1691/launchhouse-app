/**
 * src/server/storage/paths.ts
 *
 * WHAT THIS IS
 *   Every path decision in the app, in one file: where a founder's folder lives,
 *   which relative paths are allowed inside it, which files the harvest ignores,
 *   and how a person's key becomes a filename.
 *
 * WHY IT EXISTS
 *   It is the tenancy boundary. A founder id reaches this file from a session cookie
 *   and comes out as a directory name; a path reaches it from a model Write, from a
 *   download URL, or from ge's own output, and comes out as somewhere under exactly
 *   one founder's folder or as a thrown error. If a '..' or an absolute path ever
 *   gets through here, founder A reads founder B's prospects, which is the failure
 *   that ends this product. Nothing else in the app is allowed to join a path.
 *
 * WHAT CALLS IT
 *   storage/materialise.ts, storage/harvest.ts, storage/turn.ts, ge/run.ts, and the
 *   file download routes.
 *
 * READS  WORKSPACE_ROOT, through src/server/env.ts and never through process.env. It is
 *        the first segment of every founder path, so a value that is empty or relative
 *        puts every founder's folder somewhere nobody chose. Checked at boot.
 * WRITES nothing. It computes and refuses; it never touches the disk.
 *
 * IT REFUSES RATHER THAN SANITISES. There is no "strip the dots and carry on" branch
 * in this file. A sanitiser turns a hostile path into a plausible one and writes it
 * somewhere; a refusal turns it into a stack trace with the offending string in it.
 * The second is the one that gets fixed.
