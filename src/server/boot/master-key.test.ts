/**
 * src/server/boot/master-key.test.ts
 *
 * WHAT THIS IS. Tests for src/server/boot/master-key.ts.
 *
 * WHY IT EXISTS. This is the one file in the boot path where being wrong is not
 * recoverable. Everything else that fails costs a restart. A master key that is silently
 * replaced costs a founder every file they own, and nothing anywhere can get them back,
 * because the plaintext was never stored. So the refusals are the subject of this file, and
 * each one is proved by making it happen rather than by reading the code and agreeing with
 * it.
 *
 * THE FOUR THAT MATTER, and each has a test below that watches it fail:
 *   a key different from the one the files were written with is refused;
 *   a key that vanished from the Secrets pane is refused rather than regenerated;
 *   a row edited by hand so the key and the fingerprint disagree is refused;
 *   two processes booting at once end up on ONE key, not two.
 *
 * THE FAKE. A twenty line stand in for Postgres that answers the four statements this file
 * runs. It is not a database and it is not trying to be. What it has to be able to do is
 * hold a row, refuse a second insert the way `on conflict do nothing` does, and hand back
 * what is actually stored, because the third of those is what makes the concurrency test
 * mean anything.
 *
 * WHAT IT READS. Nothing outside itself. WHAT IT WRITES. Nothing.
