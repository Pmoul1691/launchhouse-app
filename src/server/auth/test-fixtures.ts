/**
 * src/server/auth/test-fixtures.ts
 *
 * WHAT THIS IS. An AuthStore held in Maps, a clock that can be wound forward, a
 * wait that records instead of waiting, and a logger that collects instead of
 * printing.
 *
 * WHY IT EXISTS. There is no Postgres on a laptop here, and there will not be
 * one in CI before the freeze. Sign in is the first thing the founder does with
 * their own deployment, in a staffed room, so it is the last path that may go
 * untested. Everything in ./types.ts is an interface for this reason, and this
 * is the other implementation.
 *
 * IT COPIES THE DATABASE'S BEHAVIOUR WHERE THAT BEHAVIOUR IS THE POINT. The
 * owner row is keyed on `founder.email`, which is unique in the schema, so
 * `ensureOwner` here refuses a second insert exactly as Postgres does. A
 * fixture that let two callers each create an owner would prove the opposite of
 * what the test claims.
 *
 * THE SLEEP RECORDS RATHER THAN SLEEPS. ./owner.ts slows a wrong passphrase
 * down deliberately, and a test that proved that by waiting two seconds is a
 * test somebody deletes. `RecordingSleep` remembers what it was asked for, so
 * the guard can be shown to fire before it is trusted to fire.
 *
 * WHAT CALLS IT. The tests in this folder and in ../routes/.
 * WHAT IT READS AND WRITES. Its own Maps. Nothing on disk, nothing over a socket.
