/**
 * src/server/auth/store-pg.ts
 *
 * WHAT THIS IS. The AuthStore over Drizzle and Postgres.
 *
 * WHY IT EXISTS. It is the other implementation of ./types.ts, and it holds the
 * two statements whose exact shape decides whether sign in is safe.
 *
 *   CLAIMING THE DEPLOYMENT IS ONE INSERT THE DATABASE IS ALLOWED TO REFUSE.
 *   A remix gets a fresh database with no founder row in it, so the first
 *   successful sign in creates one. Two tabs can reach that moment together.
 *   Reading "is there an owner" and then inserting is two statements with a gap
 *   between them that both tabs land in, and the loser meets a unique
 *   constraint violation rendered as a 500 on the founder's own screen. Here it
 *   is `insert ... on conflict do nothing` followed by a read, so the database
 *   picks the winner and both callers end on the same row.
 *
 *   THE REFUSAL COUNT IS A COUNT OF ROWS THAT ALREADY EXIST. Not a counter
 *   table and not a Map, because the process restarts and a limiter that resets
 *   on a redeploy is a limiter with a published bypass. `ge_event` is already
 *   the durable record that an attempt happened.
 *
 *   NO SECRET IS EVER STORED. There is nothing to store: the passphrase lives
 *   in Replit Secrets and the session id is a hash of a cookie and that
 *   passphrase. A dump of this database contains no credential at all.
 *
 * WHAT WENT, AND WHY IT WAS DEAD RATHER THAN UNUSED. `findFounderByEmail`,
 * `countSigninRequests`, `insertSigninTokens`, `findSigninTokenBySha`,
 * `consumeSigninToken`, `burnSigninRequest`, `burnLiveTokensForEmail` and
 * `recordMentorRequest` were the roster, the magic link token pair and the
 * mentor queue. One founder owns one deployment now. There is no roster to look
 * an address up in, no token to consume, and no mentor to queue anybody for.
 * `signin_tokens` and `mentor_requests` have no reader left in this codebase,
 * and `mentor_requests` was the only table that held an email address on
 * purpose, so dropping it removes a store of personal data from every founder's
 * own deployment.
 *
 * WHAT CALLS IT. src/server/index.ts, which builds one and hands it to the auth
 * plugin.
 *
 * WHAT IT READS. founder, sessions, api_tokens, ge_event.
 * WHAT IT WRITES. founder (once, on the first claim, including that founder's
 * wrapped data key), sessions, api_tokens, ge_event.
 *
 * NOT YET EXECUTED AGAINST A REAL DATABASE. Every statement is typechecked
 * against the real schema, which catches a wrong column and a missing filter.
 * It does not catch a permission the app role does not have. That needs one run
 * against a real database, and that run has not happened. THE INSERT IN
 * `ensureOwner` IS THE ONE TO WATCH: it is the only statement in this file that
 * writes the `founder` table, and it runs exactly once in the life of a
 * deployment, on the first sign in, in a room.
