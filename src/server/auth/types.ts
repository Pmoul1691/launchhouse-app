 *
 * WHAT THIS IS. The seams between sign in and everything it does not own: the
 * database and the clock. Interfaces only, no behaviour.
 *
 * WHY IT EXISTS. Two failures, and the second is the one that matters.
 *
 *   A sign in flow that reaches straight into Postgres cannot be tested without
 *   Postgres, and a flow nobody has run is a flow nobody has proved. Sign in is
 *   the first thing the founder does with their own deployment, in a staffed
 *   room, so it has to have been executed many times on a laptop with no
 *   database.
 *
 *   And the founder id has exactly one source: the session cookie. Writing the
 *   store as an interface makes that visible. Nothing in here accepts a founder
 *   id from a caller who did not first present a cookie, because there is no
 *   method that takes one.
 *
 * WHAT CHANGED, AND WHY THE OLD SHAPE WAS WRONG RATHER THAN INCOMPLETE. This
 * used to describe a roster of 130 people, one time sign in tokens and a
 * mailer. One founder owns one deployment now. There is no roster to look an
 * address up in, no cohort to be a member of, and no address to send anything
 * to. `SigninTokenRow` and `Mailer` are gone rather than left unused, because
 * an interface with no implementation reads in a review exactly like one that
 * works.
 *
 * WHAT CALLS IT. Every file in src/server/auth/. Wired to Drizzle by
 * ./store-pg.ts and to a Map by ./test-fixtures.ts.
 *
 * WHAT IT READS AND WRITES. Nothing. Types only.
