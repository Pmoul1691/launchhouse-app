 *
 * WHAT IT IS
 * The tests for the small pieces every screen is built out of.
 *
 * WHY IT EXISTS
 * Three properties in here are promises this app makes to a non-technical founder, and each
 * one is a single component away from being broken by accident.
 *
 * Nothing waits without saying what it is waiting for. `Working` takes the sentence as a
 * required prop, so a spinner with no explanation will not compile, and this test only has
 * to prove the sentence reaches the screen.
 *
 * Stopping keeps what was written, and the button says so before it is pressed. The reason
 * founders do not press stop is that they expect to lose the answer.
 *
 * A founder's own file cannot become markup. The markdown reader produces data, never HTML,
 * and this is the test that proves the whole path from a file to the screen escapes.
 *
 * WHAT IT READS AND WRITES. Nothing.
